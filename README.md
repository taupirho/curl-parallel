Using CURL to parallel download large datafiles

Just documenting a method of using Curl to parallel download a 
large financial data file from an FTP site.

The file is approximatley 8.5 Gig zipped and I don't know if you've tried FTP'ing
a file of that size but I can assure you it takes a while :-)
